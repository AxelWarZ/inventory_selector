This change to vorp_inventory allows items, money, and weapons to be transferred with MEGA character selection without going through player IDs.

Give roleplay immersion to your game server!

I thank MEGA for its work.
I thank FUZZY for contributing to the realization of this modification.

I hope it can be useful to someone!

Dependency: https://github.com/megaita/mega_nplayerselector

Make sure you start mega_nplayerselector before vorp_inventory.
Replace client/NUIServices and html/utils.js

Have fun :)
